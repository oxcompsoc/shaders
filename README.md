# OpenGL Shaders

Loosely, a shader is a program that runs on your GPU that is used to determine
what colour a certain pixel on screen should be. We're going to aim to right
shaders to generate pictures and animations. For some examples, go to
[Shadertoy][]. Once you've figured out the basics of how to write a shader, the
goals this evening are going to be:

* Shortest shader to draw the [CompSoc logo's sixteen dots][logo]
* A shader that can do an animation with the CompSoc logo
* Shortest shader that can draw something that the committee can recognise as a human face...
* A "3D" cube, possibly with animation

Solutions will go in this repository!
